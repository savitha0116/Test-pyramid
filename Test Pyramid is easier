                Test Pyramid is easier to Test and earlier bug detection
The Unit Testing layer of the Test Pyramid is generally considered easier to test and enables earlier bug detection.

*Why Unit Testing is Easier to Test:*
1.  *Isolated Code*: Unit tests focus on individual units of code, making it easier to isolate and test specific functionality.
2.  *Faster Test Execution*: Unit tests are typically fast to execute, allowing for quick feedback and faster development.
3.  *Less Complexity*: Unit tests have less complexity compared to integration or UI tests, making them easier to write and maintain.
4.  *Less Dependencies*: Unit tests typically have fewer dependencies, making it easier to set up and tear down test environments.

*Why Unit Testing Enables Earlier Bug Detection:*
1.  *Catch Bugs Early*: Unit tests catch bugs early in the development cycle, reducing the cost and effort required to fix them.
2.  *Test-Driven Development*: Unit tests are often written before the actual code, ensuring that the code is testable and meets requirements.
3.  *Faster Feedback Loop*: Unit tests provide fast feedback to developers, allowing them to identify and fix issues quickly.
4.  *Improved Code Quality*: Unit tests help ensure that the code is reliable, stable, and meets requirements, improving overall code quality.
