          The Agile Quadrant
In Agile, the Agile Testing Quadrants are a framework for categorizing testing activities. The quadrants are:
1. Quadrant 1: Unit Testing and Component Testing (Automated)
2. Quadrant 2: Functional Testing and Integration Testing (Automated and Manual)
3. Quadrant 3: Exploratory Testing and Usability Testing (Manual)
4. Quadrant 4: Non-Functional Testing and Performance Testing (Automated and Manual)
* Considering the nature of manual testing, I would say that Quadrant 3: Exploratory Testing and Usability Testing is the most suitable for manual testing.
Reason:
- Exploratory testing and usability testing require human intuition, creativity, and interaction with the system, which is best done manually.
- These types of testing involve exploring the system, identifying issues, and providing feedback, which is more effective when done manually.
- Automated testing may not be able to replicate the complexity and nuance of human interaction and exploration.
In Quadrant 3, manual testing is used to:
- Explore the system's functionality and identify issues
- Test the system's usability and user experience
- Provide feedback on the system's overall quality and usability
